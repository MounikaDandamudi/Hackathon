# Hackathon
Project in IBM Docker
Created a highly available Docker service which can run multiple container instances of the image. 
1. Failover to the backup node.
2. Failback to formerly active node.
Example: In production environments, companies set up redundant nodes so that a backup node can take over when the active node fails.
